OVERVIEW:

This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GCN) using PyTorch Geometric to detect fraudulent users in financial transactions. It models transactional relationships as a graph and learns risk patterns from user behavior and contextual features. The trained model achieves user-level fraud classification and visualizes network interactions to highlight high-risk entities.
